# Adopter's Version Control Guidelines

This document outlines the recommended version control and development workflow to efficiently manage changes, collaborate on feature enhancements, and ensure a controlled release process for individual adopters.&#x20;

1. **Branch Creation:**
   * Two branches will be created: "adopter-name-mainbranch-V1" and "adopter-name-release1.1.0.0" (Version for every stable releases). These branches likely serve as the main development branch and a release branch, respectively.
2. **Feature Development and Bug Fixes:**
   * Any new feature enhancements or bug fixes are developed on feature branches that are based on the appropriate starting branch (e.g., "adopter-name-release1.1.0.0").
   * Once the changes are ready, a pull request (PR) is raised to merge the changes into the "adopter-name-release1.1.0.0" branch.
3. **Testing and Review:**
   * The changes are reviewed by team members and tested to ensure they meet the required quality standards and do not introduce regressions.
4. **Merge and Integration:**
   * Once the PR is approved and the changes have been tested, they are merged into the "adopter-name-release1.1.0.0" branch.
5. **Main Branch Update:**
   * After successful testing in the release branch, the changes are then moved or merged into the "adopter-name-mainbranch-V1" (main) branch, which represents the more stable and polished version of the project.
6. **Release Process:**
   * The "adopter-name-mainbranch-V1" branch is considered the foundation for releases that are ready for deployment to production"
