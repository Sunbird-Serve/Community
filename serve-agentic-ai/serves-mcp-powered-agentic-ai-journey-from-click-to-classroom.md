# SERVE’s MCP-Powered Agentic AI Journey – From Click to Classroom

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Agentic AI (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Imagine a volunteer somewhere in the world, inspired to teach rural children.\
They click “Register” and from that moment, SERVE’s **MCP-powered Agentic AI** takes over, ensuring every step is smooth, fast, and accurate.

First, the **Volunteer Management Agentic AI** greets and guides them through onboarding, runs a quick screening, and prepares them for their teaching journey.

Next, the **Need Management Agentic AI** works in the background, turning a school’s request for a teacher into a structured plan, scheduling sessions, confirming nominations, and tracking deliverables.

Once the volunteer is ready, the AI matches them with the best-fit need. The class is scheduled, and the volunteer begins teaching.

But the support doesn’t stop there. The **Volunteer Assistant Agentic AI** sends reminders, provides teaching content, personalizes the learner’s journey, and even steps in as an AI tutor if the volunteer can’t make it to a class.

This **“Click to Class”** journey combines precision and speed from registration, readiness checks, and matching, to live teaching and learner support, all coordinated through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, enabling agents to work seamlessly together.
