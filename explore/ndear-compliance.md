# NDEAR Compliance

Sunbird Serve is an open-source, configurable, and extensible Digital Public Good (DPG) designed to facilitate volunteering initiatives. It aligns with the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) principles to enable interoperability, modularity, and scalability in the education ecosystem.

**Alignment with NDEAR Principles**

1. **Open Standards & Interoperability**
   * Sunbird Serve follows open standards (APIs, schemas, metadata structures) to ensure seamless integration with existing and new education platforms.
   * Adheres to NDEAR registries and taxonomies to maintain uniform data exchange.
2. **Modular and Configurable Architecture**
   * Built as a microservices-based architecture, enabling modular implementation and independent scaling of components.
   * Configurable workflows allow customization for various educational volunteering use cases, such as mentoring, content creation, and capacity building.
   * Allows easy plug-and-play of third-party applications via open APIs.
3. **Federated & Distributed Data Model**
   * Implements a decentralized, federated registry model, ensuring data ownership remains with respective stakeholders.
   * Enables data-sharing through secured APIs, following NDEAR’s data governance and privacy guidelines.
   * Supports multi-tenancy to cater to diverse stakeholders (government bodies, NGOs, schools, and volunteers).
4. **Scalable and Cloud-Native Design**
   * Sunbird Serve is containerized and cloud-agnostic, ensuring easy deployment on national and state cloud infrastructures.
   * Designed for horizontal scaling, supporting high-volume user interactions across multiple geographies.
5. **Extensibility & Ecosystem Enablement**
   * Provides open APIs and SDKs, allowing state governments and other organizations to extend functionalities as per their requirements.
   * Encourages a contributory ecosystem where different stakeholders can enhance features without disrupting the core architecture.
6. **Security & Privacy Compliance**
   * Ensures role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions efficiently.
   * Complies with data privacy and security policies, including encryption standards.
   * Implements audit logs and monitoring mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Conclusion**

Sunbird Serve is inherently designed to align with NDEAR’s vision of a federated, interoperable, and modular digital education ecosystem. Its scalability, openness, and configurability make it an ideal platform to support large-scale, volunteer-driven education initiatives across India.
